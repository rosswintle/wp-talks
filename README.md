# WP Talks

This is a simple plugin for storing, organising and displaying audio of talks, presentations or sermons. It was developed for use in churches, but could have other uses too.

Ability to customise output is limited at present, but templating is certainly on the roadmap for the future.

Features:

* Custom post types and taxonomies for storing and organising your talks
* Taxonomies for Speaker, Service and Topic
* An additional post type for grouping talks in series
